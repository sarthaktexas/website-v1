      h4
        | I&apos;m a #[span.underline junior] trying my hardest to not try. I&apos;m also a stressed student taking mostly AP classes. As a student on the STEM track, I focus my efforts on AP Maths and Sciences.

        | The Bowl Clubs collectively include #[em Science Bowl, Ocean Bowl, and Quiz Bowl]. Starting my second year of high school (11th grade), I was responsible for teaching incoming freshman and updating them of team practices and college-level science and math information. I curated presentations and custom textbooks to help them understand complex topics such as Calculus at an easy-to-learn level and help them understand AP Science subjects from a Pre-AP Science level. This took approximately 20 hours a week but drastically helped out team.

We instill important pillars of character such as timeliness and proactiveness to help students with college and the future ahead of them.

      h2 Projects I've worked on
      br
      h3 
        | #[a(target="_blank" href="") My Website]
      h4
        | What you're looking at right now. Made using Node.js and Express.js with a backend for some secret-stuff. Also, I've had #[em many] versions of this website, but sadly only kept 1 on my file drive.
      h3
        | #[a(target="_blank" href="https://nerdstagram.com/sarthakmohantyinc/Opes") Resource Bank]
      h4
        | #[em Extremely] secured version of a membership website made for selling resources at my school.
        | Made mainly with Node, Express, and AWS.
      h3
        | #[a(target="_blank" href="https://nerdstagram.com/sarthaktexas/kahootbot") Kahoot Hack Bot]
      h4
        | A bot to automagically answer Kahoot questions. Made when I was umm... young? So therefore it probably doesn't work anymore.
      h3
        | #[a(target="_blank" href="https://sarthakmohanty.me/403") Quizlet Hack Extension]
      h4
        | A bot to automagically answer Quizlet Live questions. Made also when I was umm... young? So therefore it probably doesn't work anymore.
      h3
        | #[a(target="_blank" href="https://sciencebowl.sarthakmohanty.me") Science Bowl Timer and Scorekeeper]
      h4
        | Made so teachers and club leaders could easily track score and track time in a practice match without a hassle. This can be used in an actual match however.
      h3
        | #[a(target="_blank" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarthaktexas/salamandarian/master/salamandarian.js") Salamandarian]
      h4
        | Salamandarian was made and used to do a poorly-executed Biology lab. We were supposed to go to random.com and roll dice and do math and count numbers, but that's hard. Just put this script into your browser and repeat for however many times you need it! This is teacher-ception.
      h3
        | #[a(target="_blank" href="https://fiveable.me") fiveable.me]
      h4
        | While the website has gone through #[em many] revisions throughout the years, I can proudly say I designed parts of the website at a time and designed many ads and marketing campaigns.
      h3
        | #[a(target="_blank" href="https://nerdstagram.com/Standard-Structure/Standard-Structure") Standard-Structure/Standard-Structure]

      h4
        | A discord bot that responds pong when you say ping. Used to teach discord.js to students.
      h3
        | #[a(target="_blank" href="https://nerdstagram.com/UndercoverGoose/quizlet") UndercoverGoose/quizlet]
      h4
        | Quizlet, Kahoot, and Gimkit hacks (yay!). Let's hope my teacher's don't stumble down here.
